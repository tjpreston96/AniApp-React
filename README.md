# AniApp v2

## Disclaimer

This project is a Node.js application from early in my coding journey converted to a React application. The conversion of this app to 'v2' is a temporary fix for an EJS error caused by the data from the Kitsu API changing. AniApp v2 is a transitional project to test my knowledge of coding principles as well as my ability to work with a pre-existing database. This is by no means a testament to my current backend knowledge as the current setup for the database is far from the most efficient method possible. AniApp v3 is already on the drawing board with a completely updated database and added features such as a Socket.io Chatroom. I hope you enjoy AniApp v2 and please check back for updates on AniApp v3.
