# AniApp v2

## Disclaimer

This project is a Node.js application from early in my coding journey converted to a React application. The conversion of this app to 'v2' is a temporary fix for an EJS error caused by the data from the Kitsu API changing. AniApp v2 is a transitional project to test my knowledge of coding principles as well as my ability to work with a pre-existing database.
